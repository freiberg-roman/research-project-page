# Research Project Page Starter
Starter template with a modern tech stack for research project pages.
No need to learn React, just update the content under the `src/app/page.js` file
and deploy using GitHub pages.

## Usage
- Clone as template and update the content under `src/app/page.js` file
- Add as many `TextBlock`, `ImageBlock`, `VideoBlock` etc. components as needed
- Add your images and videos under the `public` folder
- Link the `public` assets in the `src/app/page.js` file
- Deploy using GitHub pages
